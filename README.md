# Real-Time Traffic Analysis and Management System

## Description
Welcome to our Real-Time Traffic Analysis and Management System! Our project aims to revolutionize traffic monitoring and management by leveraging cutting-edge technologies for real-time analysis and automated actions. With our system, we analyze real-time traffic data to store vehicle number plates in a database and send alerts to authorities if any reported vehicle is suspicious. Additionally, we store number plates of vehicles that are over-speeding, issuing warnings or fines to repeat offenders. Moreover, our system utilizes machine learning models to detect cases of traffic sign violations and trigger appropriate actions.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis:** Our system continuously analyzes real-time traffic data, including vehicle number plates and speed, to identify suspicious vehicles and traffic sign violations.
- **Database Integration:** Vehicle number plates and related data are stored in a database for historical analysis and record-keeping.
- **Automated Alerts:** Alerts are automatically sent to authorities when suspicious vehicles are detected, enabling prompt action.
- **Speed Detection and Monitoring:** The system monitors vehicle speeds and stores data for vehicles exceeding speed limits, facilitating enforcement actions against repeat offenders.
- **Traffic Sign Violation Detection:** Machine learning models are employed to detect instances of traffic sign violations, allowing for timely intervention and enforcement.

## Tools and Technologies
- **TensorFlow 2.4.2:** For machine learning model development and training.
- **OpenCV:** For real-time video processing and object detection.
- **Python:** The primary programming language for system implementation and integration.
- **Django Framework:** For building the backend server and handling database operations.
- **SQLite Database:** For storing vehicle data and related information.
- **Twilio API:** For sending automated alerts and notifications to authorities.
